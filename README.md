## About Me 
My name is Matthew Lach and I am a third year Economics major. I am excited to be learning some coding and also very excited for another DH class to enhance my data vizualization skills.
## Project Ideas
I have very little coding experience (only a little bit of R in Econ classes) and am very interested in learning more about how to analyze data with python. I have always been very interested in data and data science but have had little formal experience. I hope to spark that interest once again and gain knowledge that I can expand upon in the future. In the course of this class, I would like to look at socioeconomic factors behind some of the most prominent trends we see today. The trends I am most interested in exploring further are the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change/environmetnal impact. These trends are demonstrated through the data sets I submitted. One of my main goals for this class is to gain more experience with creating maps and more complex data visualizations. I have limited map experience and my experience with data visualizations is mostly from Tableau and other softwares. I am interested in learning new ways to manage and present data in this class.
