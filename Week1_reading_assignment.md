## **Summary**
"Citizenship, Social Media, and Big Data: Current and Future Research in the Social Sciences" is an article analyzing the pros and cons of "computational social science" due to the impact of the digital age. The authors argue that the constant cahnge in th digital social science world creates a need for flexibility and extra attention to accuracy. While the techniques of big-data are useful in terms of producitvity, there are still chalenges in the way data is represented. The authors cite change in relevant platforms and effectiveness of different models as problems that need to be navigated in order to replicate results and ensure accuracy. The article also looks at some recent theory and research to see how social scientists are managing the benfits and controlling the inevitable problems in their switch to the use of big data. The article specifically looks at pursuits to gauge political and social trends through the use of social media big data. It also goes through important questions in methodology and processes that need to be accounted for when using big data.
## **Analysis**
This article opened my eyes to some of the big questions I need to ask when doing research on characteristics of the masses. I originally was planning on trying to analyze social media or google trends regarding whatever topic I choose to research. This article showed me that I can use this type of big data to draw relevant conclusions, assuming that I follow the right procedures and cross-check my results with other studies. While the article highlighted many procedural requirements fo analyzing such big data, it also highlights areas where computational methods fall short. In addition to computational limitations, there are also important concerns with the methods of visualization that stood out to me. Overall, one of the most important lessons of this article is to be cognisant of the ethical concerns of doing research and presenting findings in a digital space. Despite all the challenges mentioned, I am now more excited to look for relevant conclusions from social media, one of the most prominent communication sources we have. I think it would be especially relevant in this polarizing time to look at social media results on some of the most controversial and pressing issues for our society.
