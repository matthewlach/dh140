    "This dataset is a .geojson file showing the location of each neighborhood in Los Angeles County. I will use geopandas in order to import and analyze the data. I will use commands to present and trim the data, as well as make plots showing the location of each neighborhood. The only numerical values in the data set are the geometry data, so it may be more difficult to filter the data. By using geopandas along with the geometry column, I will make a plot of each neighborhood in LA County."
